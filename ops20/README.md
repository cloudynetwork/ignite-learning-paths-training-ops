## Getting Started

This training repository is divided in to the following sections:

|--------|-------|------------|
| 73 slides - 25 minutes, | 3 demos - 20 minutes, | 1 automated deployment

 [Full-length video can be viewed here](https://globaleventcdn.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ops/ops20/video/OPS20_Final_Full.mp4).

### **Slides**

>**What's Here?** Stage ready videos, a speaking script, numbered slide thumbnails, and the master Powerpoint slide deck.

Begin by familiarizing yourself with the presentation. Videos, speaking scripts, and the master Powerpoint slide deck can be found in the [slides](slides/README.md) section.

The Powerpoint slide deck is divided up in to four (4) sections. There are also three (3) technical demonstrations as part of the 45-minute presentation.

### **Deployment**

>**What's Here?** Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including manual steps to perform after the automation is finished

[Instructions and prerequisites are outlined here](deployment/README.md).

A "Deploy to Azure" button streamlines the process, but make sure you have created an account on Azure and generated a Service Principal ID and password before you press it.

### **Demos**

>**What's Here?** Pre-delivery preparation, stage ready videos, required files (such as JSON templates), and walk-through videos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There are 3 "live from stage" technical demonstrations that utilize a number of tools both in and out of Azure. [You can get a high level overview of the tools and how we will be using them here](tools/README.md).

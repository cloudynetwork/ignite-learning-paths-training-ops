### Browser Tab 1: Tailwind Traders

Show the Tailwind Traders application and non-functioning cart.

### Browser Tab 2: GitHub Repository

The goal of this section of the demo is to demonstrate the almost instant testing feedback when integration Azure Pipelines with GithHub.

- Create a pull request from branch < insert branch here > to the master branch of the same repository.
- Once the pull request has been created, stay on the pull request and show that the unit tests are passed through to source control.

### Browser Tab 3: Azure Pipeline Overview

- Expand each stage of the pipeline, give an overview of stages and jobs
- Menton that uniqueness to stages is that we can build gates or checks between them
- Mention that uniqueness to jobs is that all steps of a job run on the same build agent
- Give a general overview of what all stages do

Once the test stage completes

- Click on the test tab to show test results
- Point out that only the test stage ran (which we will explain in the next section of the demo)

### Browser Tab 2: GitHub Repository

Navigate back to the GitHub and merge the pull request.

### Browser Tab 3: Azure Pipeline Overview

- Show that a new instance of the pipeline has started, while it runs move onto the next step.

### Browser Tab 4: YAML Pipeline

- Collapse all stages so that the pipeline is easier to visualize/relate to the overview
- provide high-level overview
- Expand the test stage a demonstrate that there is no condition
- Expand the build stage and demonstrate the condition
- Feel free to demonstrate anything else that you have time for etc.

Move back into the slide deck while the pipeline runs.

## Demo 2

[Demo 1: Environment Tracing (3:47)](https://globaleventcdn.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ops/ops40/video/demos/ops40-demo2.mp4)

At this point, hopefully, the pre-production deployment has completed. Show how production can be reconciled .via build ID (helm release version and container image version).

### Browser Tab 1: Tailwind Traders

Show the Tailwind Traders application and now fixed cart.

### Browser Tab 3: Azure Pipeline Overview

Get the latest build id, this can be seen in the last runs URL.

![Pipeline Run URL with Build ID](./images/buildid.png)

### Browser Tab 4: YAML Pipeline

Navigate back to the pipeline YAML and show how the built-in `Build.BuildId` variable can be used as a task value.

```
- task: HelmDeploy@0
 displayName: 'helm package (tt-cart)'
 inputs:
 command: package
 chartPath: 'Deploy/helm/cart-api'
 arguments: '--version $(Build.BuildId)'
```

### Browser Tab 5: Azure Container Registry

Show that a container image has been created with a version that matches the pipeline build ID.

### Terminal

Return a list of pods to get the name of the cart pod.

```
$ kubectl get pods

```

Describe the cart pod to see the Docker image used to start it. Note that the image version matches the Build ID.

```
$ kubectl describe pod my-tt-cart-cart-api-77db6f9f58-wqs7p

Containers:
